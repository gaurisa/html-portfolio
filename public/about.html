<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>As a beginner, I am eager to take on any challenge and continuously improve my skills. Finding an internship before committing to a permanent position will yield valuable insights into professional and personal life. I have a basic understanding of HTML and CSS, but I am actively learning JavaScript and exploring libraries like Node.js and React.js to improve my web development skills. Passionate about web development, I am happy to contribute to specific projects and have a positive impact thanks to my dedication and inquisitive spirit. </p>
